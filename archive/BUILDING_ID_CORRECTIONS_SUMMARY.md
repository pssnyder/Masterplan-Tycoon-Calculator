# Masterplan Tycoon Building ID Corrections Summary

## Overview
Successfully generated corrected unique building IDs based on the new naming convention:
**Format**: `[Plan]-[Tier]-[Category]-[BuildingName+Map]`

## Naming Convention Details

### Plan Mapping
- **1** = Master
- **2** = Islands  
- **3** = Mountains
- **1** = Other (mapped to Master for consistency)

### Tier Format
- Zero-padded (00-12+)

### Category Letters
- Single letter based on production chain category
- Example: **P** = Poncho, **C** = Concrete, **S** = Steel Beams

### Building + Map Format
- Abbreviated building name + first letter of map
- **M** = Master, **I** = Islands, **N** = Mountains, **O** = Other

## Key Improvements

### 1. Consistent Naming
- **Before**: Mixed formats (2-06-P-AFI, 3-09-R-AFM, etc.)
- **After**: Standardized format (2-06-P-AFAI, 3-09-R-AFAN, etc.)

### 2. Duplicate Resolution
Found and resolved **6 buildings** with duplicate IDs:

**Duplicate ID: 1-05-C-CFAM**
- Cement Factory (Master) → `1-05-C-CFAM` ✓
- Cheese Factory (Master) → `1-05-C-CFAM_1`
- Concrete Factory (Master) → `1-05-C-CFAM_2`  
- Curdling Factory (Master) → `1-05-C-CFAM_3`

**Duplicate ID: 3-11-C-CFAN**
- Cigar Factory (Mountains) → `3-11-C-CFAN` ✓
- Crockery Factory (Mountains) → `3-11-C-CFAN_1`

### 3. Better Building Abbreviations
Improved building name abbreviations for clarity:

| Old Format | New Format | Building | Improvement |
|------------|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2-06-P-AFI | 2-06-P-AFAI | Alpaca Farm (Islands) | Added building type clarity |
| 3-09-R-AFM | 3-09-R-AFAN | Ammo Factory (Mountains) | Map letter now N (Mountains) |
| 1-04-A-AWM | 1-04-A-AWOM | Anchor Workshop (Master) | More descriptive building code |
| 1-01-B-BM  | 1-01-B-BAKM | Bakery (Master) | Clear "BAK" vs generic "B" |

## Database Statistics

### Buildings Distribution
- **Master**: 84 buildings (44.4%)
- **Mountains**: 60 buildings (31.7%)  
- **Islands**: 43 buildings (22.8%)
- **Other**: 2 buildings (1.1%)

### Top Building Categories
1. **Steel Beams**: 11 buildings
2. **Port**: 10 buildings  
3. **Overalls**: 8 buildings
4. **Steam Engine**: 8 buildings
5. **Bread**: 7 buildings

### Data Completeness
- ✅ **189 buildings** with unique corrected IDs
- ✅ **132 resources** properly categorized
- ✅ **221 input connections** mapped
- ✅ **195 output connections** mapped
- ✅ **486 construction requirements** linked
- ✅ **460 maintenance requirements** linked

## Benefits of New System

### 1. **Uniqueness Guaranteed**
- Each building has a truly unique identifier
- Duplicates automatically resolved with suffixes

### 2. **Information Dense**
- Plan, tier, category, and location all encoded in ID
- Easy to sort and group buildings programmatically

### 3. **Human Readable**
- Format is logical and memorable
- Abbreviations are intuitive

### 4. **Scalable**
- System can accommodate new plans, tiers, and buildings
- Consistent pattern for future expansions

## Next Steps

The corrected database (`masterplan_tycoon_corrected.db`) is ready for:

1. **Web Interface Integration** - Update Flask app to use corrected database
2. **Data Validation** - Compare corrected IDs with in-game building codes
3. **Production Calculator** - Use normalized data for optimization algorithms
4. **Analytics** - Leverage proper relationships for supply chain analysis

## Files Generated

- `masterplan_tycoon_corrected.db` - SQLite database with corrected building IDs
- `build_database_corrected.py` - Script to generate corrected database
- All building relationships properly mapped with foreign keys
