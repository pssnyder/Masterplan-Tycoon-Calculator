# Data Exploration Results - Masterplan Tycoon Calculator

**Generated**: September 26, 2025  
**Status**: Critical Issues Identified - Address Before Calculations

## 📊 Executive Summary

Our comprehensive data exploration has identified significant issues in the Masterplan Tycoon database that **must be addressed before running optimization calculations**. The data readiness score is **43.5/100**, indicating critical gaps that could cause infinite loops, incorrect results, or calculation failures.

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found

### 1. Circular Dependencies (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Count**: 18 circular dependencies detected
- **Examples**: Water → Water, Stone → Stone, Complex chains like Sheave → Steam Engine → Brick → Coal → Copper → Sheave
- **Risk**: Will cause infinite loops in dependency calculations
- **Solution**: Implement cycle detection with visited sets in traversal algorithms

### 2. Port Logic Gaps (HIGH PRIORITY) 
- **Count**: 4 port/transport buildings identified
- **Issue**: 1 port with no inputs/outputs (incomplete data)
- **Buildings**: Depot, Shipyard (2x), Port
- **Risk**: Transportation logic missing from calculations
- **Solution**: Create special calculation paths for ports with custom transport logic

### 3. Missing Building Connections (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **No Inputs**: 68 buildings (36% of all buildings)
- **No Outputs**: 8 buildings (4% of all buildings)
- **Risk**: Broken dependency chains, calculation dead-ends
- **Solution**: Classify as raw producers, final consumers, or incomplete data

## 📈 Database Statistics

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Buildings | 189 | ✅ Complete |
| Resources | 194 | ✅ Complete |
| Maps | 4 | ✅ Complete |
| Production Relationships | 219 | ⚠️ Has gaps |
| Cross-Map Dependencies | 0 | ✅ No complications |
| Raw Materials | 33 | ✅ Identified |

## 🔍 Specific Findings

### Resource Chain Analysis
- **Circular Dependencies**: 18 found (critical calculation breaker)
- **Isolated Resources**: 3 resources with no connections
- **Raw Materials**: 33 resources identified as base inputs
- **Dependency Depth**: Up to 5 levels deep

### Port & Transportation Analysis  
- **Transport Buildings**: 4 identified
- **Categories**: 3 bidirectional, 1 with no flows
- **Transport Chains**: 2 buildings that process same resource (Quarry: Stone, Well: Water)
- **Cross-Map Resources**: 52 resources available on multiple maps
- **Cross-Map Dependencies**: 0 (good for calculations)

### Construction & Maintenance Data
- **Missing Construction Data**: 12 buildings
- **Missing Maintenance Data**: 35 buildings
- **Zero-Cost Buildings**: 12 construction, 35 maintenance (may be valid for ports)

## 🛡️ Calculation Safety Measures Needed

### Required Before Calculations
1. **Cycle Detection**: Must implement to prevent infinite loops
2. **Safety Bounds**: Use actual save file data (1,826 buildings max)
3. **Timeout Limits**: 30-second maximum for calculations
4. **Building Count Validation**: Flag calculations exceeding 3x actual counts

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Port Special Cases**: Custom logic for transportation buildings
2. **Input/Output Validation**: Handle missing connections gracefully
3. **Production Rate Checks**: Flag unrealistic rates (>1000/min)

## 🎯 Action Plan for Optimization Calculations

### Phase 1: Critical Issue Resolution (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Implement cycle detection in dependency analyzer
- [ ] Create port building special case handlers
- [ ] Add calculation safety checker integration
- [ ] Set up timeout and iteration limits

### Phase 2: Data Quality Improvements (RECOMMENDED)
- [ ] Classify buildings with no inputs as raw producers
- [ ] Mark buildings with no outputs as final consumers
- [ ] Validate construction/maintenance data completeness
- [ ] Add port transportation cost modeling

### Phase 3: Optimization Algorithm Implementation (READY AFTER PHASES 1-2)
- [ ] Multi-level BOM explosion with cycle protection
- [ ] Mixed Integer Programming with safety bounds
- [ ] Construction sequencing with timeout limits
- [ ] Spatial optimization with validated data

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Notes

### Dependency Calculation Safety
```python
# Cycle detection pattern needed
visited = set()
recursion_stack = set()

def safe_traverse_dependencies(resource, visited, recursion_stack):
    if resource in recursion_stack:
        raise CircularDependencyError(f"Cycle detected: {resource}")
    
    if resource in visited:
        return
        
    visited.add(resource)
    recursion_stack.add(resource)
    
    # Process dependencies...
    
    recursion_stack.remove(resource)
```

### Safety Checker Integration
```python
from data_exploration.calculation_safety import create_safety_checker_from_save_file

checker = create_safety_checker_from_save_file()
result = checker.check_building_count('Well', calculated_count)
if result['status'] == 'ERROR':
    raise CalculationSafetyError(result['message'])
```

## 🏆 Success Criteria

**Ready for Calculations When:**
- [ ] Data readiness score > 80/100
- [ ] All circular dependencies resolved or handled
- [ ] Port logic implemented
- [ ] Safety checker integrated
- [ ] Timeout mechanisms in place

**Current Score: 43.5/100** ❌  
**Target Score: 80+/100** ✅

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Do not proceed with optimization calculations until the circular dependencies are resolved and safety measures are implemented. Risk of infinite loops and calculation failures.
